###### Git is distributed Version control system

- ###### Version control mean the power to go back to your previously written code ,previous version of the current code allowing you to manage and restore earlier states of your project.

###### Centralized version control system:it is a version control model where all the versions of a project are stored in a single central server.

###### Distributed Version Control System (DVCS) is dominant because the complete version history is stored both on your local computer and on a remote server.

- ###### This allows you to work independently without needing a constant internet connection, and easily collaborate with other developers when needed.
